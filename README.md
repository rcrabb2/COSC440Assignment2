# COSC440Assignment2
This program works with Linnux machines and manipulates the /etc/shadow file. \
This program requires users to be the root user as only the root user has permission to access the /etc/shadow output
In this program, a user's name is put into the system and it runs whether the password is text-based and checks sha-256, sha-512, and md5.
It is designed for dictionary-based attacks. Depending on the encryption algoritm, the program makes each of the words found in the text
file which is avaiable on reditt. For this program, I chose the encryption algorithms to be what Linux uses.
This program is heavily based on another program whose link is within the program as well in the beginning comments.
